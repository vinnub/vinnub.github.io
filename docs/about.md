# About me

I am a data scientist with a quantiative background and formal training in electrical and computer engineering and a huge passion for biological problems that data can help solve. Since grad school, my work has been at the intersection of computational biology, applied statistics and machine learning, and exploratory data science. My projects typically start by gaining an in-depth understanding of a biological problem and the related data, and then inferring novel insights by developing new algorithms and/or using existing machine learning and statistical tools. I have experience working with different types of data including immune repertoire sequencing data (NGS), clinical EHR, experimental assay, and metabolomics data (NGS, tabular, and network data) and am always fascinated by new biological problems that we can potentially help solve using data and computational methods. Outside of work, I love to play badminton and cook.


Please see my [webpage](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~vbhardwa) for more information. 

I use this website to write about technical concepts related to machine learning and data science using very simple experiments and visualizations. I have also included a list of different types of resources (mostly blog posts) that helped me during the initial years of my PhD. This list is mostly for my own reference but I have posted it here, it may of interest to some people.
