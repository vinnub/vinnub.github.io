## About me

I am Vinnu Bhardwaj, a PhD candidate at UC San Diego, with a major in data science and machine learning. 
My lifetime goal is to help advance our understanding of the human body and potentially enable new intervention opportunities by mining different types of biological data. 
My projects typically involve gaining an in-depth understanding of a biological domain and the related data, and inferring novel insights using these large datasets by developing and implementing new algorithms and/or using existing machine learning and statistical tools. 
I have worked with different types of data including immunogenomics, clinical EHR, experimental assay, and metabolomics data (sequencing, tabular, and network data) and am always fascinated by new biological problems that we can potentially help solve using data and computational methods. Please see my [webpage](http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~vbhardwa) for more information about my research. 

I use this page to write posts about technical concepts using very simple experiments and visualizations. I also have a list of different types of resources (mostly blog posts) that helped me during the initial years of my PhD. This list is for my own reference but I have posted it in case anyone finds it helpful.
